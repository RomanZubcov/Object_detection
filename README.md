# Real-Time Object Detection

This project leverages TensorFlow, OpenCV, and a pre-trained model to perform real-time object detection using a webcam feed. It identifies objects in real time and displays their labels on the video feed.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy
```
## Setup

Follow instructions:

```
-Place your trained model file keras_model.h5 and the class labels file labels.txt in the directory.
-Directory Structure: Ensure your files are organized as follows:
object_detection/
└── Object_detection/
    ├── keras_model.h5
    └── labels.txt
```
